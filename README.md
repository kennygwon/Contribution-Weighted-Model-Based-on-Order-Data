# Contribution Weighted Model Based on Order Data
## Purpose
I created a model to predict the answers to binary questions proposed in prediction markets based on the order data of market participants. The dataset I analyze comes from the Good Judgement Project and involves prediction markets speculating on whether an event will occur or not. Contracts are traded based on occurence of the event. If the event does occur, the value of the contract becomes 100 and if the event does not occur, the value of the contract is 0. My model first calculates the past profits of market participants. It then infers market participants' true belief of the probability of an event occuring using their market orders and a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function. The model then uses a Bayesian approach in weighing the contribution of participants with positive profits according to the amount of their profit. Based on other market paricipants' orders, the model is able to generate a probability of an event occuring and a confidience interval that can then be used to trade contracts in the prediction market.
## Results
Depicted below are two markets that the Contribution Weighted Model made a prediction about the true probability an event occurring. The x-axis represents the modelâ€™s estimate of the true probability of an event taking place and the y-axis represents the how likely the model thinks the estimated probability is true. The model predicted that neither event in the graphs below would come true but was more certain that the first event would not come true. In reality, the first event did not occur while the second event did occur.

To test the effectiveness of the model, I calculated the profit using 80% of the prediction markets as test data to set the parameters of the model to make predictions on the remaining 20% of prediction markets in my test data. To avoid outliers in calculating profit, I ran 50 iterations and in each iteration I randomly chose which markets would be used in the training data and which would be use test data. To calculate profit, I set the maximum amount the model can bet on a single prediction market at $10,000. I also ran a control experiment where I randomly choose to buy or sell contracts with an exposure of $5,000 for each prediction market in the test data. After running 50 iterations, I found the average profit of an iteration using the Contribution Weighted Model was $3,919. The average profit of an iteration from randomly choosing to buy or sell contracts was -$689.
